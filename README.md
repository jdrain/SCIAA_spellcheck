# SCIAA_spellcheck
This repository holds files for a spell checker

1. Improvements Needed
  + parser.py needs to deal with fields that are indicated by a check
    mark or x
  + spellcheck just needs to be better in general. Although it may be
    close to the point of diminishing returns...
2. Usage
  + spellcheck.py holds methods to run a spellchecker on a file
  + parser.py parses a file to grab pertinent info
implementing these methods
  + other files are scripts to test or implement these methods
